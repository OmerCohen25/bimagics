We’re not like those other travel insurance companies with no spice. We’re the award-winning app waking up a sleepy space. Our whole-trip travel coverage comes complete with cutting-edge technology, 24/7 customer support, speedy claims processing, and quick reimbursements anywhere in the world directly to your phone’s wallet.

We didn’t think so.\n\nWe’re taking travel insurance from a forgettable add-on to a must-have advantage that powers the freedom to roam confidently.\n\nReady to take on the world together?\n\nLife at Faye\n\nAt Faye, every day is a journey. Whether you’re building the next generation of travel products, coding new solutions, or helping travelers navigate the unexpected, your work here has a real impact on real people. Our team is as diverse as the destinations our travelers explore–made up of 62% women, 50% parents, and a few office pets. Since launching in 2022, we’ve accomplished what others in the travel insurance industry only dream of–and we’re just getting started. At Faye, we believe in growing together, having fun along the way, and making every day count.\n\nWhat we’re looking for\n\nThis is a unique opportunity to step into a high-impact role at the center of a rapidly scaling company. You will work alongside the CEO, gain exposure to all aspects of the business, and play a critical role in shaping the company’s operations and strategy.\n\nWe’re looking for a highly capable Executive Assistant to support our CEO in managing both strategic and administrative responsibilities. This is not a traditional EA role—this person will act as the CEO’s right hand, anticipating needs before they arise, ensuring seamless operations, and enabling the CEO to focus on high-impact priorities.\n\nIf you thrive in high-growth startup environments, work with speed and precision, and enjoy taking ownership of complex tasks while driving efficiency, this role is for you.\n\nResponsibilities\nAct as the CEO’s strategic partner and “shadow” – Understand company priorities, anticipate needs before they arise, and execute tasks with speed and precision.\nCalendar & Scheduling – Manage and coordinate meetings, optimize time allocation, prepare meeting agendas and ensure the CEO’s schedule runs smoothly.\nMeetings & Operations - Attend meetings, take detailed minutes, and ensure follow-up on action items.\nCommunication & Email Management – Handle correspondence on behalf of the CEO, draft responses, and maintain alignment across teams.\nReports & Documentation – Prepare presentations, reports, and key business documents.\nSpecial Projects – Oversee select strategic initiatives, manage administrative workflows, and ensure smooth execution.\nPersonal Assistance – Occasionally handle personal errands and tasks that help free up the CEO’s focus.\nGatekeeping & Prioritization - Serve as a trusted filter for incoming requests, protecting the CEO’s time by prioritizing what requires his attention and what can be delegated.\n\nRequirements\nMust have at least 2 years of prior experience as an EA to a founder or startup executive.\nBackground in law, consulting, or data analysis is a big plus!\nProactive, detail-oriented, highly organized, and a strong problem-solver. Strong organizational and time management skills, with the ability to multitask effectively.\nHigh level of commitment, flexibility, and ability to support the CEO whenever needed.\nQuick learner, strong analytical mindset, excellent communicator, and thrives in ambiguity.\nExcellent written and verbal communication skills in Hebrew and English.\nApply now\n\nTravel protection\nCompany\nResources\nLegal\nDownload the app\nFollow us\n© 2025 Zenner, Inc.
